10001,poring," Poring, a monster found all throughout Midgard, is more akin to being a mascot of Midgard than a monster. Even the bravest adventurer is no match against a Poring's cuteness. Apparently, people who adore Porings have come together and organized themselves into a Poring Supporters' Group. ""Adventurers who kill Porings without a care are heartless creatures!"" said a member of the supporters' group, wearing a Poring-shaped hat and wiping away tears.",10001.0,0
10002,fabre," Fabres, often found near crops, has only one means of self-defense—spinning silk. Yet, who could have thought that the silk produced by Fabres is the raw material for Prontera's luxury silk? ""They are aggressive when they are hungry but they continue to spin silk docilely one fed. What a simple nature!"" remarked Monster Researcher Bertha as she stood in the field and wrote in her notebook. ""That's enough! Get these insects off my farm right away!"" cried Bertha's father angrily from the side.",10002.0,0
10003,pupa," When Fabres reach a certain stage of growth, they turn into Pupae, seen everywhere out in the fields. Rumor has it that in the quiet of the night, the pupae split open to reveal the Creamy incubated inside, but as nobody has ever seen the complete process of a Creamy emerging from a pupa, how much truth there is in the rumor remains to be verified. Monster Researcher Bertha would like to remind everyone that the Fabre contributes greatly for mankind, so please do not break open pupae just for fun!",10003.0,0
10004,lunatic," The bunny monster which dwells near Prontera South Gate has an inexhaustible store of energy hidden within its tiny body. Despite a Lunatic's cute appearance, due to the fact that its fur is an excellent material, there are already calls to set up a ""Lunatic Conservation Society."" The following is an extract from the important news section of the Kingdom Times: Novices should take care in distinguishing the color of the Lunatic's fur. Should an Eclipse be discovered, please hide immediately and inform the Kingdom Defense Force!",10004.0,0
10005,thief bug egg," In the kingdom's sewers, brown spherical objects, sticky and extremely disgusting, can be seen all over the place. Nobody who can avoid it will ever dream of touching it.

10006,chonchon," A flying monster with big watery eyes. According to research statistics, the Sunflower Nectar outside the West Gate is their favorite food. Chonchons bloated from feasting on nectar hovering low in the air are often seen there. ""... So why are they called Chonchons?!"" yelled Ygnizem as she ran away, unable to strike at the Chonchons due to their cuteness.",10006.0,0
10007,willow," A sentient plant monster freed from the restriction of its roots. Though it looks rather scary, its nature is actually very playful like a little child. As Willows of very small sizes exist, the monster research academia has reasons to believe that there are great variations in size between different Willows. ""The Willows we have found at present are all in their infancy. An adult Willow Sage must be..."" Monster Researcher Bertha's eyes brightened.",10007.0,0
10008,roda frog," An amazing saltwater frog most often found dwelling in the shallowest parts of seas. Apparently, they feed on Chonchons, but no crossing of paths has been discovered between the two in their natural habitat, so it remains unproven. There are even rumors of Roda Frogs being capable of reading, comprehending, taking a liking to human books. ""Those are all tall tales. They're just normal sea monsters,"" yawned Hayden who runs a business by the sea all year round, waving his hand dismissively.",10008.0,0
10009,thief bug," Once an insignificant bug, but mutated once corrupted by the dark energy in the sewers. Adventurers should be advised not to show it any mercy.

The Kingdom Defense Force is now in communication with the Thief Bug lovers. Negotiation is still ongoing.",10009.0,0
10010,grasshopper," A grasshopper-shaped monster with a violin in hand that possesses extraordinary musical talent. Apparently, music is their means of communication.

10011,picky," A cute chick monster that never seems to grow up from the moment of its birth. The debate about their appearance in their true complete form has yet to cease amongst the academics. It is in tight competition with the Drops for the first place on Morroc's ranking for the most popular monster. However, do not underestimate their attack. These little fellas have caused the injuries and deaths of several adventurers. The following is an extract from a warning board in the Morroc wilderness: Please exercise caution when dealing with harmless-looking monsters!",10011.0,0
10012,drops," A Fire Poring with a cute appearance similar to normal Porings. However, due to its own magic attribute, Drops can purify more advanced materials than normal Porings. Perhaps it is because they understand this point too, Drops are not as docile and friendly as normal Porings in interacting with humans. It is in a tight competition with the Picky for the first place on Morroc's ranking for the most popular monster. However, on the kingdom's ranking for the most popular monster, it is still a long way behind the Poring.",10012.0,0
10013,pecopeco egg," Pecopeco Egg Shells can be grounded into a shiny powder. It is an excellent raw material for decorations and is popular in the kingdom.

10014,condor," Condors living in the desert are extremely proud and cannot stand being deprived of their freedom. However, they do not appear as handsome closeup as they do up in the sky. In fact, they look somewhat silly. Perhaps even if they were astoundingly handsome, they would still lose out as they are associated with the word ""con.""  A friendly reminder from Monster Researcher Bertha: Be extra careful of their cries if you wish to keep your eardrums intact.",10014.0,0
10015,savage bebe," A monster which passes off as cute and innocent with its appearance, but viciousness can occasionally be observed from its gaze. It often dashes around on its short legs in the wilderness beyond the West Gate, often accidentally bumping into adventurers before being pet by them for a good while. Perhaps their original intention may have been to attack.",10015.0,0
10016,baby desert wolf," To quicken the growth of their pups, Desert Wolves always leave them to fend for themselves. Therefore, groups of Baby Desert Wolves can always be seen living together.

10017,pecopeco," A bird monster which can only walk upright despite having wings. Its sharp and powerfully-built beak can scare away egg thieves from afar. After all, once an angry Pecopeco has its eyes on you, it won't be possible to get away without losing some blood. ""Thank goodness I run fast. Otherwise it wouldn't have just been that egg thief who got a good pecking,"" sighed Pet Merchant Lyra, still in lingering shock.",10017.0,0
10018,muka," A desert monster with amazing facial expressions. Despite having an appearance similar to a cactus, it is actually a dancer with a musical soul at heart, and can start swaying to a rhythm at any time. ""Nobody thinks about quenching thirst with it, unless you are willing to have a row of Muka beard on your chin,"" said gourmet chef Stefanie as she blew away the sand in her fingernails, looking at the Muka some distance away with a grin.",10018.0,0
10019,metaller," Some Grasshoppers have gone astray in the pursuit of their musical dreams and have become obsessed with heavy metal. The language their violins play has become completely independent from that of their original race. Therefore, they have a new name. The kingdom's ecology conservation society has already dispatched specialists to keep an eye on the state of development of the Metallers and to follow up on their evolution at all times.",10019.0,0
10020,anacondaq," New adventurers easily overlook how poisonous they are, but to experienced adventurers, their Venom is a rather remarkable profit-making material. As a result, organizations such as the Anacondaq Conservation Society have come into being. After all, when the buying stops, the killing can too!",10020.0,0
10021,scorpion," A formidable existence in the desert. Its stinger and two pincers radiate an aura of danger and even the mesmerizing purple tail cannot conceal the intimidation of its poison. Rumor has it that thousands of adventurers have been stung by them. ""Keep that scary thing away from me. Haven't you heard Monster Conservation Society's news? It's extremely likely to evolve into a giant scorpion,"" said Rylai, tightening her protective clothing and taking another two steps back.",10021.0,0
10022,golem," A monster with very obvious man-made traces. Nobody knows how they appeared. Traces of having been built out of bricks cover their entire body and amagical light shines from their eyes.

10023,hode," Few are the adventurers who have seen Hodes in their entirety in the desert. Apparently, strange large eyes hide beneath those budging and wriggling sand dunes, but nobody has been able to provide photos as evidence yet.  The following comes from a Monster Conservation Society's notice: Please do not dig pits all over the place to take a photo of a Hode. This speeds up the degradation of the natural ecological environment.",10023.0,0
10024,desert wolf," Due to the cruel experiences they went through when they were young, they have grown into fearsome Desert Wolves skilled in fighting. After experiencing countless battles, their fur have turned into hardened armor and are no longer worth as much as the soft fur they had when they were young. However, apparently, there are still people secretly buying adult Desert Wolf Fur for use as armor material on the Black Market.",10024.0,0
10025,frilldora," A dangerous-looking animal with ugly features. However, they actually feed on pests all year round and make great contributions to the conservation of the environment. Hopefully biologists can help them restore the reputation they deserve someday.",10025.0,0
10027,hornet," Death after a stinging attack is a thing of the past. The stinger is its present combat weapon. Its appearance is similar to a cross between a bee and a spirit. Despite having a cute human face, it is aggressive and does not like losing, never admitting defeat upon encountering a strong rival. Ygnizem is one of their victims.",10027.0,0
10028,ambernite," A slow, crawling animal on the surface. The mysterious patterns on the Ambernite shell that faintly give off a magical aura will escape notice without close observation.  According to information from the Geffen Guild, Ambernites are a type of stealthy magical creature and highly dangerous. Please be careful!",10028.0,0
10029,wormtail," A mouse with a giant onion growing on its body. You may think of them in this way, but do not ever voice it out. They are creatures born naturally in the forests and apparently have a certain degree of divinity. Best not to trifle with them.",10029.0,0
10030,dustiness," A Chonchon that is fast-moving and with sharp mouthparts. Be careful not to be stung by it, or you may lose a lot of blood.  ""Not one part of its entire body has any edible value.

10031,horn," An aggressive fellow. The Horn on its head is the key to it being crowned the King of Insects. Apparently, some people have them engage in fights for fun after taming them, but evidence has yet been found.",10031.0,0
10033,side winder," An Anacondaq residing inside a pyramid. Although it looks no different from the Anacondaqs outside, since it can survive safe and sound in the poison-filled air within the pyramids for years on end, it must have its own extraordinary venom. Adventurers, please treasure your lives and stay away from Side Winders.",10033.0,0
10034,ground petite," The branch of Petite dragons dwelling on land. Currently, monster researchers are still studying why such a huge difference exists within one race. However, the Ground Petites are no lower in status although they are unable to fly. Despite being the dragons of legend, somehow they are not as intimidating.",10034.0,0
10035,sky petite," The branch of Petite dragons capable of flight. Currently, monster researchers are still studying why such a huge difference exists within one race. The Sky Petites put on a prouder air to the outside world, but their status within the race is in doubt. Rumor has it that the Sky Petites have sent a letter of challenge to the Ground Petites. It seems they have long held the belief that it is high time the superiority between the Ground Petites and the Sky Petites is determined.",10035.0,0
10036,elder willow," Monster researchers have discovered after many studies that complete fire elements exist within the bodies of Earth Spirit Elders, seemingly overcoming their bodily restrictions.

10037,eggyra," A strange creature shrouded in mystery, sharing the title of Midgard's Monster of Mystery together with the Magnolia.

Who knows what may happen if that is done?",10037.0,0
10038,bigfoot," A large bear with brown fur. Docile in nature and does not initiate attacks against humans. Similar in appearance to the Sasquatch.

10039,savage," No discovery of baby monsters with matching biological characteristics to this monster has been found. Legend has it that Savage Bebes are the young of Savages, but the vast differences between their habitats and physical appearances are unexplainable, and so it remains a mystery for the biologists. ""It is far too hasty to conclude the two are from the same race solely on the basis of the additional 'Bebe' in the name."" Monster Researcher Bertha firmly refuses to acknowledge any relationship between Savages and Savage Bebes.",10039.0,0
10040,magnolia," Magnolia, with its mysterious origins, has always been the favorite topic of discussion among monster lovers. The most commonly accepted explanation about its origins at present is that someone broke edible Pecopeco Eggs and the restless souls inside the eggs transformed into Magnolias which fry themselves continually.

10041,dokebi," Demi-humans from a primitive civilization. Researchers are currently studying their potential associations with the Giearth, Goblin, and other civilizations.

10042,horong," Flames wandering where the dead are found. Anyone who touches it will be unwittingly burnt. Whether it is a type of monster or a natural phenomenon is still a mystery. However, in Payon's local culture, evil ghosts are believed to be behind it.",10042.0,0

10044,familiar," A weak creature living in the darkness. Unless they band together in groups, they pose no threat. They always watch their invading enemies silently from the dark.

10045,spore," Appears harmless, but the Spore Hat on its head is the actual source of danger. Apparently, its real body is hidden behind its astonishingly large mouth. Many can't help reaching out to touch it after being bewitched by the cute expression of its lower body, and so they end up offering a delicious hand for the Spore's dinner.",10045.0,0

10048,female thief bug," A mutated Thief Bug monster corrupted by the dark energy in the sewers. Its attack and agility are far greater than a normal Thief Bug.

10052,poporing," Although the Poison Poporing also has a sizable fanbase, some adventurers are still concerned about its poison and do not dare to touch it casually. According to Finch's latest research, Poporing's Poison attribute manifests as resistance to poison instead of being poisonous. Adventurers may rest assured.",10052.0,0
10053,snake," An Anacondaq living in Payon's forests. It looks no different from the snakes outside. Its colors look terrifying but it is actually non-venomous. Nonetheless, a bite from its sharp fangs will still leave you in pain for days. Don't provoke carelessly~",10053.0,0
10054,creamy," Fabre's imago form. It only inhabits the Labyrinth Forest and survives by sucking nectar. A Creamy's wings are very beautiful, completely incomparable to its appearance when it was a Fabre. The nectar gathered by Creamies is an excellent health supplement, provided you can survive their attacks to enjoy it.",10054.0,0
10055,stainer, A brightly colored insect. It has many natural enemies but has survived thanks to its powerful reproductive capabilities. Each Stainer has a fixed number of 8 spots on its body. Is this a characteristic of the race? A special reminder: Stainer Shells are edible!,10055.0,0
10056,steel chonchon," It belongs to the same race as Chonchons but has even more exotic colors, as though informing all creatures on sight that it is very dangerous and strangers ought not approach. Such a warning also indirectly protects itself. However, apparently, there is still a group of Chonchon-hunting hobbyists who occasionally provoke them despite the danger. Of course, the price is rather painful. After all, it doesn't feel good being besieged by a swarm of Steel Chonchons.",10056.0,0
10057,coco," A cute monster with a big tail. The bushy tail is not only their key to climbing trees easily, but also the cutest part of their entire body. Cocos' survival depends on gathering Acorns. Don't ever take their Acorns!",10057.0,0

10059,caramel," A weak and cowardly monster willing to sacrifice its own spines in self-defense. Promise me that you won't ever think of attacking them. Their spines are lost for good upon use, and a Caramel with no spines left isn't a Caramel anymore.",10059.0,0

10061,pirate skeleton," A skeleton dressed as a sailor. They must have been brave and good at fighting when they were alive. However, their taste in fashion doesn't seem to be any good.

10062,megalodon," In the crowded Megalo monster clan, they seem insignificant, with little pure blood inherited, but their furious nature is totally an undeniable truth. Born with powerful jaws, they could bite through bones. Surprisingly, however, they seem to be attracted only to moving objects, and become much less aggressive against stationary things. ""Megalodons have nothing but bones in their bodies, and no food is needed. Given this, it is assumed that they don't hunt for food, but follow their instincts."" The famous Monster Researcher adjusted the glasses, and left a signature on the essay just finished.",10062.0,0
10063,poison spore," A mushroom monster that appears in dark sewers. Its body swaying to and fro and its wicked expression are exactly identical to a Spore's.

10067,shellfish," Inhabiting the shoal near Kokomo Beach, they are shy and timid. They rarely attack humans, and only threats bring out their intimidating strength.

10073,marine sphere," Usually curled into a ball in a corner and completely still, it is easily overlooked if little attention is paid.

Therefore, adventurers wishing to hunt Marine Spheres should take extra notice.",10073.0,0

What a mystery...""",10076.0,0
10077,merman," Monsters with the body of a human and the head of a fish, capable of living on the earth and underwater, with two respiratory systems. Usually hidden in the deep sea, they are sometimes found on the land for some reason. According to many Adventurers who have faced a Merman, they are cunning monsters with knowledge of human languages. An arrogant oversight, and you are in for their traps. ""O eyes of the abyss, gaze into them and you are deprived of rationality. O whispers of the ancient gods, open your ears and you will sacrifice your soul..."" At a night without moonlight, on a shoal touched by waves, Mermen gather in a circle, enchanting the creepy songs...",10077.0,0
